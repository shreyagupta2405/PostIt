***React*** : Front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.

***React Router Dom*** : Responsibile for rendering UI components according to the URL paths.

***Express*** : Back end web application framework for Node.js (a JavaScript runtime environment).

***Firebase*** : Google-backed application development software. Specifically used here for user authentication and storage(Firestore Database+Storage) of chats, files, etc. 

***NodeJs*** : Node.js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services

***Material UI*** : Design language developed by Google which lets developers incorporate pre-built react components. Specifically used here only for designing the video chat and "Add files" modal.

***CORS*** : A HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any other origins (domain, scheme, or port) than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources. Used here for communicating between server and client side hosted on Heroku and Netlify respectively.

***The library I used in this project for front-end*** : 

Axis,
Material ui,
Redux,
firebase,
Jwt decode,
react-file-base64,
react-html5-camera-photo,
redux-thunk,
uuid.

***The library I used in this project for back-end*** :

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Agile methodology followed during the build

Agile is an easy to handle and flexible development process which relies on light(short-termed) planning procedures. It allows faster adjustments and reviewing with an aim of keeping the principle of zero bug bounce. Implementation of this method is done via a disciplined work breakdown, which I handled as depicted in the following :

## üí° Challenges faced and learnings

- Had very basic knowledge of React before the Microsoft Engage Program's qualification announcement. Spent about 100hrs learning the new concepts attached to React and then began the design-build process of this project.
- For my love of frontend styling, I took up the challenge of styling the page delicately.
- Never implemented user authentication before. Understood how to register apps on Github and make use of their API's for user authentication.
- Never incorporated a realtime database storage like mongoDb and Firebase to my projects before. 
- Developed a full stack app with frontend, backend and database for the first time integrating ML model. Struggled through it but documentations and tutorials came to the rescue as always. 
- Never worked with ML models before. Had tp extensively reasearch on that.
- Learnt about Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
- Faced most challenges during integrating ML model with the web app using flask and database using mongoDB and Firebase.
